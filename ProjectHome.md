IrfanPaint is a plug-in that adds painting features to IrfanView; it doesn't aim to compete with "heavy" photo editing software, instead it is intended as a nice addition to IrfanView editing capabilities to allow "quick and dirty" edits on images.
Although it is based heavily on Windows GDI, an important objective for the future is to replace all the GDI code and use the great AGG library instead.
